<h2>Hi there, I'm Josie (she/her), let's create together!</h2>

Just a grateful being looking to bring more beauty and justice to the world by harnessing the power of humane technology. Currently cultivating my software development skills at [Datasite](https://www.datasite.com/us/en.html) as an Associate Software Engineer.

<h3>Let's chat about</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Books! I've read over 100 books in 2020 and would love to give and receive recommendations for 2021.
  <li>How to make our technology more accessible, socially responsible, and compassionate.
  <li>What projects you are excited to build! I'm currently creating an application that would allow users to exchange surplus produce and goods to prevent food           waste. What motivates your applications?
</ul>

<h3>When I'm not coding I'm...</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>traveling! I love backpacking and exploring new cultures and places. Let's swap packing tips & tricks!
    <li>somewhere outside. I feel most at ease when I am fully immersed in nature. I love hiking, scuba diving, camping, you name it!
    <li>embodying Lizzo and "working on my fitness"..trying to make a healthy lifestyle feel less like a chore and more like a reward. Currently into dance exercise         routines, experimenting with plant-based recipes, building a handstand into my yoga practice, and listening to music way too loud when I run.</li>
 </ul>
