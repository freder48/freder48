<h2>Hi there, I'm Josie (she/her), let's create together!</h2>

Just a grateful being looking to bring more beauty and justice to the world by harnessing the power of humane technology. Currently cultivating my software development skills at [Datasite](https://www.datasite.com/us/en.html) as a Software Engineer.

<h3>Let's chat about</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Books! I've read over 100 books in 2023 and would love to give and receive recommendations for 2024.
  <li>How to make our technology more accessible, socially responsible, and compassionate.
  <li>What projects you are excited to build! I'm currently creating an application that would allow users to exchange surplus produce and goods to prevent food           waste. What motivates your applications?
</ul>
